## Signing-up for Google Colab
1. Create a Google account if you do not have one already.
2. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/.
3. If you see a “Sign in” button in the top right corner of the screen, click it and sign in using your Google account. If you see your account’s profile picture instead, you are already signed in.
4. In the top right corner of the screen, there is also a “Connect” button. Click it. A successful connection will confirm you are logged in correctly.
5. Feel free to explore the default “Welcome to Colaboratory” notebook (the one opened by default when you visit the website). Execute some code cells and familiarise yourself with the environment. This step is entirely optional as we will cover this in the course.
